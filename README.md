# AJAX Redux - Star Wars API Character/Movie Guide

## Overview
This repository contains the code and assets for the AJAX Redux project, a character and movie guide utilizing the Star Wars API (SWAPI). This project dynamically populates a list of Star Wars characters, where each character acts as a link to display movie details, including the title, opening crawl, and a poster.

The project incorporates AJAX calls with robust error handling, responsive design for different devices, and animations using GreenSock (GSAP).
